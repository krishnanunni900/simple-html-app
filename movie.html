 <p><b>Kumbalangi Nights (transl. Nights of Kumbalangi) is a 2019 Indian Malayalam-language romantic comedy drama film[1] directed by Madhu C. Narayanan. The directorial debut was written by Syam Pushkaran and jointly produced by Fahadh Faasil and Nazriya Nazim under their production house Fahadh Faasil and Friends, in association with Dileesh Pothan and Syam Pushkaran under Working Class Hero.[4] The film stars Shane Nigam, Fahadh Faasil, Soubin Shahir and Sreenath Bhasi, along with debutants Anna Ben, Grace Antony and Mathew Thomas in pivotal roles.[5][6][7] The cinematography and editing were handled by Shyju Khalid and Saiju Sreedharan, respectively. The soundtrack and background score is composed by Sushin Shyam.</b>

<i>Set in the eponymous fishing village of Kumbalangi in Kochi, Kerala, the film centres on the strained relationship between four brothers living together in a dysfunctional home, and how they ultimately stand up for each other as a family. Syam came up with the idea for the film based on the time he spent in the village in his twenties. In 2011, he discussed the story with then-assistant director Madhu, who decided to make his directorial debut with it. By 2016, Fahadh and Pothan, both of whom had worked closely with Madhu and Syam on previous films, had agreed to co-produce the film. Madhu then spent a year in Kumbalangi to understand its culture better, before shooting began in September 2018.</i></p>
